Project Overview: CLI-Based Chat Application

Description:
This project entails the development of a command-line-interface (CLI) based chat application. It serves as an educational tool to delve into the intricacies of socket programming and multithreading. The application facilitates real-time communication among multiple users connected to a common server.

Key Components:

Socket Programming Demonstration:
    Illustrates fundamental concepts of server-client communication using sockets.
    Provides insights into establishing connections, sending, and receiving data between server and client.
Integration of Sockets and Multithreading:
    Explores the integration of socket programming with multithreading.
    Demonstrates how multithreading enhances the scalability and responsiveness of the chat application.
CLI-Based Chat Functionality:
    Enables users to connect to the server and engage in text-based communication via the command line.
    Supports features such as choosing a nickname, sending messages, and executing commands like /kick and /ban (admin privileges).
